# 📈 Whoosh Stock Price Prediction using Monte Carlo Simulation  

## 📌 Overview  
This Python program analyzes historical **Whoosh stock prices** from a CSV file and predicts future prices using a **Monte Carlo simulation**. The model relies purely on historical data with statistical adjustments, without incorporating external market factors.  

🚨 **Disclaimer:** While the model is not fundamentally qualitative, past predictions for Whoosh prices have been accurate.  

## 🏗️ Features  
✔️ Loads **Whoosh stock price** data from a CSV file using `pandas`  
✔️ Applies **Monte Carlo simulations** to estimate future price movements  
✔️ Uses **statistical parameters** to refine predictions  
✔️ Generates **visual plots** with `matplotlib.pyplot` for analysis  

## 📦 Dependencies  
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
